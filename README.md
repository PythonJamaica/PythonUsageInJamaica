# Python Usage In Jamaica
A project to measure PythonUsage in Jamaica.

## Goal
To determine usage by industry, location(parish), type of usage (web, infrastructure), frameworks in use 

## Methodology

The first pass will rely on self reporting, so we expect it to be a bit skewed but having some data will be better than none.

## Considerations

We're aware that some of the usage is grass roots and not officially sanctioned by management and some is incidental because the tools being used are powered by Python. We will need to determine how best to categorise these types of scenarios.
