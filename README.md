# PythonUsageInJamaica
A project to measure PythonUsage in Jamaica.

## Goal
To determine usage by industry, location(parish), type of usage (web, infrastructure) 

## Methodology

The first pass will rely on self reporting, so we expect it to be a bit skewed but having some data will be better than none.
